# Warehouse Schema Synchronization Rule

The SQL schema defined in [create-wms-schema.sql](mdc:deliveroo/wms-data-generator/src/create-wms-schema.sql) **must always be kept in sync** with the ER diagram in [wms-er-diagram.mmd](mdc:deliveroo/wms-data-generator/src/wms-er-diagram.mmd)

## What must be synchronized?
- **Tables/entities**: Every entity in the ER diagram must have a corresponding table in the SQL schema, and vice versa.
- **Columns/attributes**: All attributes (with correct types) must match between the ER diagram and the SQL schema.
- **Primary keys**: Every primary key in the ER diagram must be present and correctly defined in the SQL schema.
- **Foreign keys**: All relationships and foreign keys must be implemented in the SQL schema, matching the ER diagram's cardinality and constraints.
- **Indexes**: Any indexes implied by relationships or performance needs in the ER diagram should be present in the SQL schema.
- **Constraints**: All constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, ON DELETE, etc.) must be reflected in both files.

## When to update?
- If you change the ER diagram (add/remove entities, attributes, relationships, keys, etc.), you **must** update the SQL schema to match.
- If you change the SQL schema (add/remove tables, columns, keys, constraints, etc.), you **must** update the ER diagram to match.

## How to check?
- Review both files after any change to ensure:
  - All tables/entities, columns/attributes, keys, and relationships are present and consistent.
  - All constraints and indexes are implemented as described.

## Example
If you add a new table/entity or relationship in @warehouse-er.mmd, you must add the corresponding table, columns, keys, and constraints in [create-wms-schema.sql](mdc:deliveroo/wms-data-generator/src/create-wms-schema.sql), and vice versa.
