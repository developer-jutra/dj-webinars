# ADR 001: Monolithic vs. Distributed Architecture for Transportation Service (DUMMY)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The transportation service must handle transport order management, route planning, driver and vehicle assignment, tracking, and integration with warehousing and external services. The team must decide whether to implement the transportation service as a monolithic application or as a distributed microservices-based system.

## Alternatives

- Monolithic application (single deployable unit)
- Distributed microservices architecture
- Modular monolith

## Decision

We will implement the transportation service as a monolithic application.

## Consequences

- **Easier**: Simpler deployment and operational management; easier to maintain transactional consistency; lower initial complexity.
- **More difficult**: Scaling specific components independently; potential for slower development as the system grows; harder to adopt new technologies for specific modules.
