# ADR 003: Centralized vs. Decentralized Authentication and Authorization (DUMMY)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The transportation service must authenticate and authorize users (dispatchers, drivers, clients, admins). The team must decide whether to manage authentication/authorization internally or delegate to a centralized identity provider.

## Alternatives

- Internal authentication and authorization within the transportation service
- Centralized identity provider (e.g., OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SSO)
- Hybrid approach

## Decision

We will use a centralized identity provider for authentication and authorization.

## Consequences

- **Easier**: Single sign-on for users across multiple systems; centralized user management and auditing; improved security.
- **More difficult**: Dependency on external identity provider availability; added complexity in initial integration.
