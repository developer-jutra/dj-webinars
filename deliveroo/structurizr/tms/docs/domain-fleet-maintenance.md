For industrial cargo trucks, regular maintenance is much more frequent and structured than for personal cars, due to higher mileage, heavier loads, and safety regulations. The standard in the trucking industry is to follow a preventive maintenance schedule based on mileage, time intervals, and specific component wear.

### Typical Industrial Truck Maintenance Intervals

- **Weekly:** Basic inspections (battery, belts, hoses, chassis lubrication, suspension, brakes, air filters, HVAC, DEF levels).
- **Monthly:** Oil and filter change, transmission fluid check, fuel and exhaust system inspection, brake check.
- **Quarterly:** Tire rotation and alignment, detailed brake inspection, coolant system check, suspension inspection, cabin air filter replacement.
- **Semi-Annually (every 6 months):** Fluid flushes (coolant, brake, transmission), drive shaft and U-joint inspection, DPF cleaning, turbocharger and electrical system inspection.
- **Annually:** Comprehensive overhaul—major engine and transmission checks, complete brake system overhaul, chassis and body inspection, emission testing.

### Mileage-Based Guidelines

- **Medium-duty trucks:** Service every 10,000–25,000 miles (oil, filters, inspections), more in-depth maintenance every 25,000–50,000 miles.
- **Heavy-duty trucks:** Basic service every 10,000–20,000 miles; air/fuel filter replacement every 30,000 miles.
- **Always refer to the manufacturer’s manual for exact intervals, as they can vary based on truck model, usage, and conditions.**

### Legal and Industry Minimums

- **Mandatory annual mechanical inspection** is required for heavy trucks in most jurisdictions.
- **General preventive maintenance** should be performed at least every 6 months, but most fleets operate on a much tighter schedule, especially for high-mileage vehicles.

### Why So Frequent?

- Trucks accumulate mileage and wear much faster than individual cars.
- Regular, scheduled maintenance reduces breakdowns, improves safety, and ensures compliance with regulations.
- Many fleets use telematics and maintenance management software to track and enforce these schedules.

**Summary:**  
Industrial cargo trucks typically undergo some form of maintenance every week, with more comprehensive checks monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. Preventive maintenance is often scheduled by mileage (every 10,000–20,000 miles for basic service) or by time (every few weeks or months), whichever comes first. This is much more frequent than the annual service typical for personal vehicles.
