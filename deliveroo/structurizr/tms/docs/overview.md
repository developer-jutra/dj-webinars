## Core Business Rules (Transportation)

Business rules ensure correct, safe, and compliant transportation operations:

- **Order data validation**: When creating a transport order (locations, time, completeness)
- **Fleet availability check**: Before order approval
- **Load limits verification**: When assigning a vehicle (weight, volume)
- **Driver working hours control**: Before assigning a driver
- **Driver license/permit check**: When assigning a driver (e.g., hazardous goods)
- **Route feasibility check**: When planning the route (distance, restrictions)
- **Transport time window validation**: Before transport start
- **Real-time monitoring requirement**: During transport execution
- **Incident reporting requirement**: Upon breakdowns or delays
