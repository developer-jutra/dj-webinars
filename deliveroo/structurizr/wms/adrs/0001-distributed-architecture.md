# ADR 001: Monolithic vs. Distributed Architecture for Warehousing Management System (DUMMY)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The warehousing management system (WMS) must support inventory tracking, goods handling, reservations, and integration with transport and ERP systems. As the business grows, scalability, maintainability, and integration needs become more critical. We need to decide whether to build the WMS as a monolithic application or as a distributed (microservices-based) system.

## Alternatives

- Monolithic application (single deployable unit)
- Distributed microservices architecture
- Modular monolith

## Decision

We will implement the warehousing management system as a distributed microservices architecture.

## Consequences

- **Easier**: Scaling individual components (e.g., inventory, reservations) independently; integrating with external systems; deploying updates to specific services.
- **More difficult**: Managing distributed transactions; increased operational complexity; need for robust inter-service communication and monitoring.
