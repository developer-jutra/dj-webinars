# ADR 002: Event-Driven Integration Between Warehousing and Transport Systems (DUMMY)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The WMS must synchronize with the transport management system (TMS) to handle events such as goods arrival, goods release, and transport order updates. Tight coupling could lead to brittle integrations and scalability issues.

## Alternatives

- Synchronous REST API calls between WMS and TMS
- Event-driven integration using a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Batch file exchange

## Decision

We will use event-driven integration via a message broker for communication between the warehousing and transport systems.

## Consequences

- **Easier**: Decoupling of systems; asynchronous processing; improved scalability and resilience; easier to add new consumers (e.g., analytics, notifications).
- **More difficult**: Increased complexity in handling eventual consistency; need for monitoring and managing message queues; potential debugging challenges.
