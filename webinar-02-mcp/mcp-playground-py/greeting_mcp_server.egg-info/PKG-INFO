# Greeting MCP Server

A simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides a greeting tool using stdio transport.

## Overview

This server implements a single "greet" tool that takes a name parameter and returns a personalized greeting. The greeting will tell the person whether they are awesome (if their name starts with 'A') or not awesome (otherwise).

## Installation

### Option 1: Install dependencies only

```
pip install mcp
```

### Option 2: Install as a package

```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Run directly as a script

```
python greeting_server.py
```

### Run using MCP CLI (development mode)

```
mcp dev greeting_server.py
```

This enables testing with MCP Inspector:

```
mcp inspector
```

### Run as an installed package

```
greeting-server
```

## Integration with MCP clients

This server uses stdio transport and can be integrated with any MCP client that supports this transport type, such as:

- Claude Desktop
- Other AI applications with MCP support

When connected, the client can call the `greet` tool with a name parameter to receive a personalized greeting.
